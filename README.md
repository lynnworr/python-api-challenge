# python api challenge
 
There were two parts to this challenge, WeatherPy and VacationPy. 
We will start with WeatherPy. In this challenge we were to find any relationships and coorelations between several different variables.
In the WeatherPy file, I've expained in detail about any coorelation that was or wasn't present in the scatter plot.

The second part was the VacationPy. This challenge has me narrow down a list of cities as potential candidates as vacation spots
based on several different factors. A map was generated to show the cities locations around the world and also a map with 
hotels that are within 10 kilometers from my location.
